# REACT-REDUX-Middleware-and-Thunks

## Intro 
- In Redux middleware performs asynchronous operation (as API calls) and then updates the state
- Asynchronous tasks are tasks that take time to complete
## Middleware in Redux
- Helps with Redux side effects: 
   - [Middleware intercepts an action dispatched and passes that action to the reducer]
   - Redux actions are dispatched to the store and processed by reducers to provide a new state, components that reference the new state are then upate or re-rendered.
- Common Tasks Middlewares Perform
  - logging,
  - caching,
  - adding auth tokens to request headers,
  - crash reporting,
  - routing, and 
  - making asynchronous requests for data
- In the Redux Toolkit a redux-Thunk function makes asynchronous requests possible:

      createAsychThunk() and its extraReducers property
## Write Your Own Middleware
- To __*ADD*__ middleware import the Redux function: `import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux'`
- __*NOW*__ Along with the reducer within createStore( sliceReducer ) add applyMiddleware( )

      createstore( applyMiddleWare( ) )
- __*THEN*__ calls to dispatch are calls to the middleware pipeline

      actions pass: middleware ---> to middleware ---> before app reducer
#### MIDDLEWARE STRUCTURE [A pipeline of neSted functions ] 

                  *** MIDDLEWARE FUNCTION: ***
      const exampleMiddleware = storeAPI => next =>
        action => {
                 // Body Performs the Task
        return next(action);       
      }      // This function call to the next middleware with the current action
            // Passes the action on to the pipeline's next middleware
- Middlewares have access to: `storeAPI` Which give them access to:

        `dispatch`, `getState`, `next` middleware, and dispatched `action`
- Actions are passed down the pipeline untill the last middleware
- Last middleware function call --> next(action) --> results in dispatching to the store.

        next(action) ---> becomes storeAPI.dispatch [a call to stores contents]
#### MIDDLEWARE ARE PASSED INTO createStore with 3 arguments:

      const store = createStore( arg1=reducer, arg2=initialValueOfTheStore, arg3=applyMiddleware(createMiddleware))
##### To dispatch an action after store created

      store.dispatch({'The action to dispatch can be a `message`'})
      store.dispatch(action={type:"some_value", action:"some_value"})
## Intro to Thunks
- Thunks allow asynchronous requests in REDUX.
- A thunk is a higher-order function it wraps code into packages to compute later
## Promise Lifecycle Actions
- A Promise lifecycle :
   - begins as __*pending*__ and moves to either __*fulfilled*__ or __*rejected STATES*__.
- A Good user experience requires advising the user of the __*STATE*__ of the async requests at any moment
- For asynchronous operations:

        A DISPATCHED ACTION is:
           a "Pending" action before the operation --> the result operation is "FulFilled" or "Rejected"

## createAsyncThunk( )
- Redux Tookit provides a function to help with asynchronous tasks in a slice

         const ThunkActionCreator = createAsyncThunk( 'actionType string' , PayloadCreator)

- __*createAsyncThunk( param1, param2 )*__ --> returns __thunk Action Creator__

        import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
        
        const actionName = createAsyncThunk( 'SliceName/ActionName', //Action Type string
              async (arg,thunkAPI) => {                  //Async Thunk function
                              // Body of the payload creator
                               // returns a promise })

- Pass an asynchronous thunk function into createAsyncThunk( ) function returns an action creator that dispatches the action types/actions --> pending/fulfilled/rejected.

## Passing Arguments to Thunks/Payload Creator
- The async function passed to `createAsyncThunk` receives 2 arguments
  
           async ( arg & thunkAPI )=>{ payload creator arguments}
   - arg - # of arguments passed to thunk action creator
     
          Single Value --> createAsyncThunk(actionCreatorName(value1), )
          Multiple Values an object --> createAsyncThunk(actionCreatorName({key1: value1, key2: value2}), )
          E6 Destructure --> createAsyncThunk(actionCreatorName({ value1,value2 },)
  
   - thunkAPI - An object containing methods store's dispatch, getState()

            const fetchUserById = createAsyncThunk(
                   'users/fetchUserById', // action type
                   async (userId, thunkAPI) => { // payload creator
                          const response = await fetchUser(userId)
                          return response.data
                         }
               )      
## Actions Generated by createAsyncThunk()
- `createAsyncThunk(ACTION TYPE STRING)` dispatches actions for each of the promise lifecycle STATES

      `createAsyncThunk('resourceType/actionType')`--> dispatched ACTION TYPES
  
                       'resourceType/actionType/pending'
                       'resourceType/actionType/fulfilled'
                       'resourceType/actionType/rejected'
- Eg. `createAsyncThunk('users/fetchUserById')` --> 3 ACTION TYPES

                  'users/fetchUserById/pending'
                  'users/fetchUserById/fulfilled'
                  'users/fetchUserById/rejected'
- To access these action creators

                  `fetchUserById.pending`
                  `fetchUserById.fulfilled`
                  `fetchUserById.rejected`
